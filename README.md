It's a cooking recipe app built with Expo react native:

* I used formik and yup to build dynamic form with form validation to help users upload valid recipes.

* I used firebase for text authentication and image storage and database.

* Part of app UI is what I borrowed from the design of Spotify IOS UI.
* The search function is implemented using text align algoirthm.
